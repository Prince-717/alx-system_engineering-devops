NETWORKING BASICS
This readme file provides a brief overview of some networking basics related to localhost, 0.0.0.0, and the /etc/hosts file.

Localhost
Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device. It is commonly represented by the IP address 127.0.0.1. When a program or service is configured to listen on the localhost, it can be accessed by connecting to the IP address 127.0.0.1 or using the hostname "localhost." Localhost allows programs to communicate with each other locally without the need for an external network connection.

0.0.0.0
0.0.0.0 is a special IP address used in the context of networking. It represents all available network interfaces on a device. When a program or service is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0, it means it is accepting incoming connections from any available network interface. This is useful when you want a service to be accessible from any network interface on the device.

/etc/hosts File
The /etc/hosts file is a plain text file present in most operating systems. It acts as a local DNS (Domain Name System) lookup table. The hosts file allows you to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a local override for DNS resolution. When a device needs to resolve a hostname to an IP address, it first checks the hosts file before querying external DNS servers.

You can edit the hosts file to add custom mappings between hostnames and IP addresses. This is commonly used for local development, testing, or blocking access to certain websites by redirecting their hostnames to a different IP address. The hosts file is located at /etc/hosts on Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.

To add an entry to the hosts file, follow this format: <IP address> <hostname>. For example, 127.0.0.1 localhost maps the hostname "localhost" to the IP address 127.0.0.1.

It's important to note that changes made to the hosts file only affect the local system. Other devices on the network will not be affected by these changes.

Conclusion
Understanding these networking basics can be helpful when working with network-related configurations on your local system. Localhost and 0.0.0.0 are used to specify network interfaces, allowing programs to communicate locally or accept connections from any available interface. The hosts file provides a means to override DNS resolution locally, allowing you to map hostnames to specific IP addresses.
